# main.py
"""
Minimal runner so everything works out of the box:

- Imports generate_chat_turn from dialog.py
- Keeps a simple REPL (type in the terminal) so you can quickly test:
    /girls
    /pick 3
    /intro
    /books
    /memory sfw
    /nsfw_on
    /memory nsfw
    /help
    /quit

If you later plug this into a web framework, you can import `generate_chat_turn`
and call it the same way with your own state management.
